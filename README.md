# Alpaca Google Doodle

 Dogs come to mind when most people think "therapy animal." However, therapy alpacas are becoming increasingly common at hospitals, health care facilities, and retirement homes around the world. Pet Partners, the largest and perhaps most well-known therapy animal group in the U.S., keeps about 20 llamas and alpacas, a spokesperson told The New York Times. As it turns out, they make great hiking partners and bedside companions.

The alpacas are the newest addition to a stable of therapy animals used at Andrus to help children who have suffered severe trauma, stress and other emotional-health issues, as well as children with autism and ADHD. They were introduced to each other last week.

We can teach our alpacas to trust us, and through repeated interactions they can become extremely
trusting of the work we want them to do and very sensitive to clients and their needs. The fact that they are
smaller and less intimidating than horses, for example, makes them more approachable.
